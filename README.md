# PortfolioProjects

This repository is for me to explore my own mini projects to learn technical skills that I have not learnt in school. 
I hope to be able to start on my own project without assistance or guidance soon.

I'm currently exploring the basics as a data analytics beginner, such as SQL, Python and Tableau! :)
